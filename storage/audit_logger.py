"""Audit logging for user actions and configuration changes.

To meet compliance requirements, it is often necessary to record every
administrative action performed through the system: adding/removing
watchlist entries, enrolling identities, modifying rules, etc. The
`AuditLogger` writes these events to a JSONL file with timestamps and
details.

This logger is separate from the main `EventLogger`, which records
runtime detection events. Keeping audit logs distinct helps with
organizational separation of duties and simplifies retention policies.
