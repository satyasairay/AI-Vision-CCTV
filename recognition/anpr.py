"""Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR).

This module defines the `ANPR` class responsible for extracting and
recognizing license plates from vehicle images. It uses an OCR engine
such as EasyOCR or PaddleOCR, which should be installed locally via
the setup script. The `recognize` method returns the recognized text
and a confidence score.
