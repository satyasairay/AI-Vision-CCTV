"""Periocular/eye region recognition module.

In situations where individuals wear masks, full face recognition is
impractical. This module defines `EyeRecognition` for performing
biometric recognition using only the eye region (periocular area). It
serves as a placeholder for integrating a lightweight neural network
trained on periocular images. Use the `identify` method to compare
extracted eye regions against a gallery of known identities.
