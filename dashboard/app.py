"""Streamlit dashboard application.

This dashboard allows users to monitor live camera feeds, view detection
results, and inspect logged events. Running this script with Streamlit
will start a local web server accessible in your browser. The dashboard
interacts with the underlying modules (camera adapters, detection,
tracking, recognition, rule engine, storage) to display realâ€‘time data.

Note: This is a minimal implementation to illustrate the structure. You
will need to extend it to handle live video streaming and integrate the
full pipeline.
