"""Deep SORT tracker implementation (placeholder).

The Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm extends SORT
by incorporating appearance descriptors to improve performance on multi‑object
tracking tasks. This module defines a `DeepSortTracker` class that assigns
unique IDs to detected objects and updates their trajectories across
successive frames.

Note: This is a placeholder implementation. To implement Deep SORT
properly, integrate a Kalman filter, an appearance encoder, and data
association via the Hungarian algorithm or a similar method.
